# Voice-Enabled Chatbot
## Overview
This project is a fully voice-enabled chatbot that enables seamless spoken English interactions. The system integrates:

1. Speech-to-Text (ASR): Converts spoken input into text.
2. Large Language Model (LLM): Processes transcribed input and generates responses.
3. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts chatbot responses into clear, natural speech.
The chatbot supports real-time conversation with minimal delays and high accuracy.
